Using the SOM algorithm to layout a curve in a two-dimensional plane so that it passes a set of points. In fact, this can be interpreted as a variant of the travelling salesman problem.
The training points correspond to the cities and the curve corresponds to the tour. SOM algorithm should be able to find a fairly short route which passes all cities.
